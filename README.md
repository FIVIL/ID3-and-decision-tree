## Description

### Expert System

In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as ifâ€“then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software. An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.

### ID3 Decision Tree

In decision tree learning, ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) is an algorithm invented by Ross Quinlan used to generate a decision tree from a dataset. ID3 is the precursor to the C4.5 algorithm, and is typically used in the machine learning and natural language processing domains.([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm))

## This Project

This application applies ID3 algorithms on a heart diseases data sets in order to create a decision tree and then uses the tree for starting a expert system which can identifies common heart diseases.

## Clone

You can simply clone this repo and run the code, using Visual Studio 2017+
